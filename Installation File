To use this script:

Save it as a file, for example, cms_setup.sql.
You can run this script in several ways:
a. Using the MySQL command line client:
Copymysql -u your_username -p < cms_setup.sql
You'll be prompted to enter your MySQL password.
b. Using phpMyAdmin:

Log in to phpMyAdmin
Select the "Import" tab
Choose the cms_setup.sql file and click "Go"

c. Using a MySQL GUI tool like MySQL Workbench:

Open the tool and connect to your MySQL server
Open the cms_setup.sql file
Execute the script


This script will:

Create the cms database if it doesn't already exist
Create all the tables you specified (users, place_courier, feedback, franchise, staff)
Add the new columns we discussed earlier to the place_courier table



Note that this script uses IF NOT EXISTS clauses, so it's safe to run multiple times without causing errors if the database or tables already exist.
Remember to replace your_username with your actual MySQL username when running the script from the command line.
Is there anything else you'd like to add or modify in this setup script?
